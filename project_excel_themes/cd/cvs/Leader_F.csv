1,"The fact the XXX has more women than men overall yet has a small to no percentage of women in the most senior positions is evidence of a serious problem. There is a frat boy culture that makes it very difficult for women to be part of the ""club"" or they need to sacrifice their personality to be part of it. It's a very difficult environment at the top. ",G_L_D_H,WE_MA,CA_PO_L,
2,"It's pretty clear that gender diversity can use some improvements here, especially at the ED+ level (I realize we just promo'd two women to SVP). It will be interesting to see how we accomplish this, and how we accomplish it at Director and below levels given that we've flattened the org in a big way. My POV is that as much as many women (and even men) may want to advance, the business need for the advancement doesn't really exist anymore.  It may not be like that forever, but it feels like that will be the case for 2018 and 2019 as we rebuild and refocus.",G_L_D,G_L_D_H,CA_PO_L,CA_L
3,"This comment applies to all of the questions in this section.  I have noticed a dramatic shift in the messaging frequency and content re: gender diversity and career development opportunities at XXX in the past few months.  There has been a much greater emphasis placed on consistently reaching out, to creating new channels for communication, and of course, for the impactful promotions of women to our ELT.  I am hopeful that this cultural change will continue and will result in real change for women's career satisfaction, for improving diversity throughout our ranks, and truly embracing an inclusive culture.  Very encouraging and important work being done by the company.  Kudos!",CA_PO_L,Culture Change in positive ,G_L_D_H,
4,"There is a general notion that at XXX, women are tested and men are promoted",G_L_D,CA_PO_U,,
5,I have been continually disappointed by the lack of gender diversity in the C-suite.   I am encouraged by recent changes to correct this inequity.,G_L_D,,,
6,"There has been a negative perception in the past about XXX not having women in executive leadership positions and the attitude / lack of respect for women at the executive level. However, I feel positive about some of the recent promotions of women into ELT positions and our new leadership's position on diversity and gender equality. My own experience at XXX has been positive; I feel like I have had equal opportunity and was recently promoted into a leadership position. I am positive about my own division's VP and the CPO, and believe they are committed to diversity and treat everyone equally. ",G_L_D_H,CA_PO_P,CA_PO_E,
7,"I personally haven't felt discriminated against, or held back because of my gender, but the optics around this issue make it hard to deny that it exists.  An ELT with 0 women, role openings and promotions seemingly going to men far more often than women - when both are qualified, etc.",G_D_P,G_L_D_H,CA_PO_U,
8,"My perception is that there is gender diversity (or equal placement of women and men) in associate, manager, senior manager and director roles.  The imbalance seems to occur or at least start to occur as you go up the hierarchy ladder.  ",G_D_P,G_L_D_H,,
9,"The company has denied that there are any issues with gender at the company for as long as I've been with XXX. I'm glad to hear that there is an awareness and openness to improve, however I hope that we can set our aspirations high and do what is needed to be the BEST company for women and other diverse employees. ",NEP_GD,WE_imp_?,,
10,I'd love to see more diversity in XXX's leadership but I do not want XXX to over rotate in this area. I'd much rather have a leader who do so effectively regardless of gender. ,others,,,
11,Women are valued in roles through mid management to get things done but are not rewarded with promotions in the same way men are.,CA_PO_U,G_UE_V,,
12,"As a female with XXX for over 10 years, I have never felt as if my gender was getting in the way of me progressing in my career.  I was given a director position over a male and I've continued to be assigned highly visible projects.  I care more about diversity in general at XXX than I do gender diversity.  It's almost all white men in leadership, and where there are women in leadership, it's usually a white woman.  Forget about gender, let's focus on diversity period.",G_P_D_H,LTE,Diversity period,
13,"I'm reasonably confident that a plurality of senior leaders recognize that the status quo is unsustainable from a gender diversity perspective, but I worry that there may still be pockets where the perspective is that it's either not a problem, or it's someone else's problem.  Particularly in Sales, Product and CTO orgs, the lack of women in leadership positions (and in soon-to-be-leader positions) is striking.  Not only do we not have representation, but the internal pipeline is a lot weaker than in Marketing, Finance, XXXCentral, etc.  It seems like some parts of the company have an abundance of women and a strong pipeline, and other areas...just don't",G_L_D_H,pass the buck,WE_L_E,
14,"it's hard to answer these questions about women GENERALLY, when I only have the experience of ONE woman - me.  That said, I don't think our issues are captured in this survey.  I think our issues are systems and processes and 20 years of history and bias with a founder who didn't believe in this.  It's not about ""workplace flexibility policy"" it's about ""I forgot about Julie because she's working from home today, and I didn't see her in the office, and it's an out of sight out of mind thing..."" so Julie doesn't get the opportunity.  It's more that we haven't made this DELIBERATE.",WE_PS_Prm,LTE,WE_MPrm,
15,"There is a glass ceiling here at XXX. Women have to prove themselves before they get promoted, whereas we consistently take changes on men. We keep weak male leaders in their positions and continue to reward them rather than the strong women underneath. ",G_D_L_H,CA_PO_U,CD_RI_F,
16,"I think XXX is trying hard to support gender diversity, at least through communications. ",Realize_Prm,,,
17,"It's nice that leadership is starting to pay lip-service to gender diversity. It's nice that we put women on ELT for optics given the public pressure we're now under. But I've yet to see meaningful commitments to lasting change. Many talented, high-performing women are stuck at the Sr Manager, Director, and ED cohorts. When I start to see them moving, I'll feel like women have an equal shot at XXX.",Realize_Prm,G_Dis_Def,,
18,I,none,,,
19,"Diversity in dev, outside of Clinicals, is horrible. Recent departures of several women leaders in Clinicals makes it worse.  The company as a whole employs many women, but the majority are in lower-paying jobs, such as customer service. Before the agile transformation, there were lots of new grads hired as PIs to complement the new grad devs.  Many of the PIs were women.  Some stayed through the agile transformation, if they had achieved some success already.  Many left, in favor of hiring POs with more experience in that role.  Those have turned out to be mostly men, in my area. ",G_D_L,CD_under_pay,CA_PO_U,
20,"The same opportunities and promotions are not available to women.  Career path advice and feedback is biased, whether the men are aware of it or not.",CA_PO_U,,,
21,"I am happy to see the executive team being so vocal about this issue.  The discussion has changed to a more realistic acknowledgement that something is awry that won't be fixed by waiting or by simply hiring a female executive.  Many companies have the same issues we do, the difference is that we are ready to tackle it openly.  An interesting thing for us to study is the pattern at XXX over the last 10 years, as there were many women in leadership positions in the earlier days of the company.  Why did they all leave, and what has changed in our environment?",Realize_Prm,,,
22,There is definitely a ceiling at XXX and not many women break through it.  Even those who have don't seem to last long here.  I wonder why?,CA_PO_U,,,
23,"80% of healthcare workforce are women, yet SLT at XXX has historically been less than 10% women. ",others,,,
24,"It is unacceptable to have such a lack of woman in the VP, SVP, and Executive team cohorts at XXX.",G_L_D_H,,,
25,"Opportunity depends on which group you report into.  Some senior leaders advance women as quickly as men. I think the client facing organization has not advanced women to positions above director as quickly or easily as men.  Women have to prove themselves year after year and still may not advance; my impression is that after one good year, a man as an opportunity to move up to ED or VP. ",CA_PO_L_Dep_sale,,,
26,"There is a gap between ""Leadership"" and ""Executives"" and a confidence in the group being committed to gender diversity. There is a bit of a boys club at the executive level and they seem more comfortable letting other boys in.  ",G_L_D_H,WE_MA,,
27,Great diversity at lowest levels and declines steadily as you advance up  SM's belief was that all were hired/ retained/ promoted based on ability but did not appear to be true in the past.  Hopeful for the future,G_P_D_L,CA_PO_U,,
28,We need more women in VP+ positions.  We need to make good on our pledge to interview at least one women for every VP+ open role (which didn't happen when Kyle left and Jon P took the vast majority of his job and direct reports.,G_L_D_H,,,
29,"already known, but we need more women at VP and above cohort and even in the ED cohort.  Also diversity beyond gender.",G_L_D_H,,,
30,"My perception is that there has been a serious problem at the senior exec level which prevented women from obtaining or succeeding in ELT roles.  The resulting boys club had a very negative trickle down affect.  I am very optimisitic about the new and interim leadership and believe they are already creating change.  It will take time before we know if this is systemic change or superficial, but it is very positive.",G_L_D_H,WE_MA,,
31,"It is known that we need to have more qualified and successful women in leadership roles, but it is the ""how"" that needs to be answered since many seats are filled by men.",G_L_D_H,,,
32,"The higher you go in the organization, the fewer women there are; when you reach ELT,  there are none.",G_L_D_H,,,
33,There is no gender diversity once you get above director. You don't need a survey to tell you that. You know that. ,G_L_D_H,,,
34,"- C level is all men and it is challenging to know whether opportunities were offered to women and transparency into those decisions. - Women seem to be strong in early leadership roles with no clear indication why it drops off at VP, SVP and above. - Whi",G_L_D_H,,,
35,"I believe middle management and lower cohorts do a fantastic job of attracting diverse talent and treating people equally. Above Director, the balance is much harder as expectations for workload and presence are not in line with the needs of a dual-working household. ",G_P_D_L,G_L_D_H,,
36,"Women are not getting promoted at the same rate as men, despite evaluations, even though often women are judged harsher than men.  I bet if there was a blind review of leadership resumes with the names hidden, women on average would be judged to belong to greater leadership levels than they are today. There are many highly qualified women that were brought in recently below their qualifications and some men that were hired well over their qualifications at the leadership level. ",CA_PO_U,,,

40,Gender diversity seems lacking at the upper ranks,G_P_D_H,,,
41,"This isn't much gender diversity at VP or above. It seems like the pack thins out and plateaus at ED. We haven't been able to attract and retain visible woman leaders. It would be great to have role models that are representative of the general population (balance work and family, etc).",others,,,
