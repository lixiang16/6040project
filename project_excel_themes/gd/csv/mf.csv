"The main area I notice a lack of gender diversity is in Senior Leadership. There are female managers and directors in my department, but once you move up to the VP level and beyond, I don't see very many women.",G_L_D_H,,,,
"I believe that there are efforts from the lower levels up to promote gender diversity, and at the lower levels we're doing OK, but it's glaringly obvious that as you go up, there are fewer women. And I feel like executive leadership hasn't prioritized fixing that imbalance, but Collector leadership, for example, has.",Impv,G_L_D_H,,,
it's not just about the gender but also diversity with ethnicity in the workplace. We need more females but also need to diversify different cultures here at XXX,G_L_D,WE_L_CD,,,
"We need to employ/retain or promote women at the leadership level - the reason behind departures of Kristi and Di were very unclear to the general employee public, but certainly concerning and noted. As is the constant promoting of men from within when we have an opening at the SLT level. ",CA_PO_U,G_L_D_H,,,
"I think that the bar for promotion is set much lower for men than for women, and the higher the level, the more this is true.  During the review process, I have heard over and over from my manager, ""It's not what you do, it's HOW you do it that matters.""  This idea is used to discount quality work and real real results, by saying things like, ""Yes, but you failed to establish cross-team relationships"" or, ""Yes, but you didn't influence the company's  strategic direction.""   So it doesn't count.  We are not being evaluated on our work, instead we are evaluated on how good we are at schmoozing and making people like us. If we advocate for a position, we are ""strident"" and ""undiplomatic.""  If we take an opposing view, we are not ""team players,""  when in fact, we are doing the best thing for XXX and for our clients.  Hard skills seem to count for nothing in the performance review process.  What seems to matter is whether our manager likes us. And as women, for our manager to like us, we have to be non-threatening, and and in need of help and support in his eyes.  And therefore, not ready for promotion. Catch 22 ",G_L_D,WE_L_Eff,,,
"All people should be treated equally, regardless of gender or how they identify themselves. We should not need special groups with preferential treatment ERGs. Everyone should be judged based on the merits of their work.",None,,,,
All talk but no action,WE-_L_Eff,,,,
"The history of XXX gender diversity at leadership levels is VERY poor. Few women have been in the ELT, and they have tended to be the first to be ""exited"" when issues arise. This casts doubt on opportunity for all women.",G_L_D_H,,,,
Until recently there were no women in senior leadership. I am happy that this has changed.,G_L_D_H,Imp,,,
Gender diversity in R&D and leadership (especially ELT) should continue to be addressed. ,G_L_D_H,Imp,,,
"Is Amy going to be introduced to the company?  She's been on the board, but now she's part of ELT and I have no idea about her besides her bio online.  Also, didn't appear to address that data strategy used to be Prakash and is now Amy...hmmmmm.....",NONE,Story,,,
"I visually see plenty of men and women walking around campus but I want to call out that they are predominantly white.  And if we want to talk about gender diversity within teams in the organization, the numbers are very skewed - most of our developers are white young men.  Developers are treated special at XXX, and typically much better than everyone else.  And when most of your developers are visibly young white men who are treated very well.. it tends to send a not-so-subtle message to everyone else.  ",CD_L_CD,CD_WM,WE_L_CD,,
Not a lot of gender diversity above manager,G_L_D_H,,,,
"While I think that XXX is better than many companies with regard to equal pay. We're still not dollar-for-dollar. Until we are, I'd like us not to ""celebrate/promote"" that we're better than most. I'd also like to know what work is being done to get us to that 1:1 benchmark.",NONE,,,,
IMHO I would list gender diversity as XXX's second biggest problem compromising our culture.  ,G_L_D,WE_L_Cul,,,
"Overall the people make XXX and at lower levels, there is such great respect for each other. It's when we get into the higher levels that it seems to be a problem (see my culture note below). We've had some female leaders that were super competitive and downright aggressive - almost didn't want other women to succeed - not all of the higher level women leaving were losses for diversity by any means. ",G_L_D_H,G_Dis_Def,other,the higher level female leaders is too aggressive to badly influence other women's promotion and success,
"Overall, this needs drastic improvement. I have seen many high performing Senior Managers and Managers, particularly women, leave XXX in the past 1-2 years because how to advance or the opportunity to advance has not been made available or clear. The lack of diversity at Leadership also makes high performers who want to obtain levels beyond their current cohort question if it is obtainable at XXX. ",G_L_D_H,WE_Q_PO,,,
"XXX's very diverse until the Director/Executive Director cohort, especially in Operations. There are opportunities available for coaching and mentoring for women both as part of the manager curriculum and employee groups like Women's Leadership Forum.",N_G_L_D,,,,
"We need more of it at all levels, particularly outside of the XXXPeople team.  Expanding ELT to include Jessie and Lorraine as well as including Colleen and Amy in ELT meetings is a great first step.  However, the historic list of women in ELT at XXX has almost always been in HR-related functions. Next, we need to figure out how to support women across all functions of XXX so that having a female CTO, CPO, or COO does not feel so impossible. ",G_L_D_H,Impv,,,
Gender diversity is a challenge at almost every company.  While XXX could benefit from some greater gender diversity at the most senior roles (VP+) it feels as though there is decent diversity from Associate thru Director.  I've also felt it's a topic XXX's facing head on.  Trying to do their best to discuss and address the current state what shifts might need to be made etc. ,Impv,N_G_L_D,,,
Gender diversity is good through the Sr. Mgr levels.  It feels like Director and higher are very much male dominated. ,WE_MA,,,,
"There is such a clear, sustained dropoff of women (and people of color) after the director level that is it completely discouraging and one of the poorest reflections of our shortcomings as a company. ",None,,,,
Happy to have to new female members of the  SLT ,Impv,,,,
"Gender diversity seems to vary wildly by product and team. I've been on a technical teams where women outnumbered men, but I've also been the only woman on my team.",N_G_L_D,other,,,
In general the biggest issues impacting gender diversity at XXX includes the following: 1) There are no women on the executive senior leadership team 2) There are few woment on the senior leadership team (VP and up) 3) The attitude has been that women have 'left' due to personal reasons and 'they chose' a different path. However the reality is that XXX has a long way to  go to ensure that women (especially women with families) can feel and actually advance within their careers w/o feeling they need to jeopardize their families and/or their work in order to advance. ,G_L_D_H,Other,,,
"In my opinion, the worst part about the lack of gender diversity in leadership at XXX is the fact that there are very very few role models for young women. During career development discussions with a manager, men with less experience can point to several different examples of jobs held by men, but women have a much more difficult time seeing that path. It becomes easier and easier to think, ""Well, no other woman has made it to director...maybe it's just not for me"" or ""Maybe I _should_ stay home when I have children because it must just be too hard to work at that point in my life."" ",G_L_D_H,G_few_R_Fm,,Other,
"I think that in the analyst through senior manager and possibly up to director level of the company, diversity feels balanced, its at the director level that it starts to shift very heavily towards white men.",G_L_D_H,,,,
"A lot of people, especially in the lower cohorts, are commited to gender diversity, but for a few years this has not been a top priority for Senior Leadership. There are pockets of enthusiasm from some Director-level individuals, which, while greatly appreciated and respected, do not translate to a company-wide approach. Still, having those individuals at Director level and above look out for us means a lot to me and is much appreciated.",N_G_L_Lw,G_L_D_H,,,
I believe some teams do much better at this than others.  ,NONE,,,,
"As a female at XXX, I feel career opportunities are as open to me as they are for my male counterparts if I choose to pursue them.  ",CA_PO_E,,,,
"XXX has done a lot of talking about gender diversity but very little walking or for that matter crawling.  For years, our C-suite contained either zero women or a token women, and the rumors were that the women was in the suite to control the bad behavior.  If you look across cohorts women dominate the lower cohorts are above or on par at the manager level - but when you get to Sr. Mgr the numbers reverse.  Some call out the dominance of women in Executive Director positions - I would call out that women were often promoted to ED while many men were promoted straight to VP prior to ED being a thing.  XXX is giving my great experience right now, but when I am ready to move to Director I know that it will be easier to climb outside of XXX.",G_L_D_H,CA_PO_U,CD_under.est_Fm,,
"As a female, I might not be as concerned as others about representation, but rather that folks are receiving the same opportunity, regardless of gender, team, or role. While I don't feel that it's as explicit and controversial as being passed over for a promotion in favor of a male (or other gender), I believe our issues are buried deeper and unconsciously. Men have routinely been given stretch roles that folks know they're not ready for, but that they will ""Grow into"", but women are told they need to demonstrate that additional cohort and scope for 1-2 years before being given the opportunity. That's going to take a lot longer to fix, and I fear why so many women have given up. ",CA_PO_E,CA_Q.est_U,,,
"Gender diversity is prominent in lower ranks, and outside of tech. The lower gender diversity in tech isn't an XXX problem, it's an industry problem (funnel starts from STEM education). ",N_G_L_D_Lw,,,,
"Coming from a very male-dominated enterprise software environment, XXX's approach to gender diversity and employee development has been a breath of fresh air.",WE_MA,Impv,,,
"For me, the most discouraging example of gender diversity (or lack thereof) appears at the executive level, where there are no females represented. In the past, when there have been female executives, they have left the company after only a short period of time. In my experience, the executive leadership team has not made a big enough effort to promote gender diversity at the highest levels of the company, and has not looked inwardly enough after women who do make it to those levels leave prematurely.",G_L_D_H,CA_PO_U,,,
"While I have not personally experienced any exceptional growth and opportunities due to my gender, I absolutely see the disparity at the leadership and Executive level. There is a tremendous opportunity to expand our gender diversity footprint at all levels, but especially at leadership and Executive. ",N_G_L_D,G_L_D_H,,,
"The complete lack of women in senior leadership positions until last week had a strong impact on my perception that women could not advance past a certain point at this company. It's encouraging to see 3 women named to ELT, but for my perception to change, it will take seeing more women promoted to the Exec. Director and VP levels, too.",G_L_D_H,Impv,,,
Lots of talk but not enough action taken.,GD_Talk_more_fix_few,,,,
"Restating the obvious here, but we have a problem advancing women into leadership positions.  I think it is due to a combination of lack of support but also just overall ""boys club"" at the top for so long.  I am glad to see this being openly discussed and hope we begin to see changes.",WE_MA,G_L_D_H,,,
I believe there are efforts but employees and mangers look to have HR fix and do not want to be held accountable for contributing to the solution. ,Impv,,,,
"I'm consistently struck by how often we talk about gender diversity being a problem but how differently we approach the resolution compared to other company issues.  When we had to cut $100 million in spending, appointed cross-organizational committees did a thorough sweep of the entire company and worked collaboratively to meet financial metrics and achieve company goals.  Why do we take such a different approach to diversity?  We make commitments to do better, but we don't put plans in place that helps us meet defined goals. My hope for the next step in this company's commitment to diversity is a more tangible and defined approach, particularly one that emphasizes individual responsibility with organizational leaders and that creates and enforces a system of accountability.   Additionally, I think it is important to remember that diversity does not just mean gender diversity.  While we are tackling gender disparities now, XXX has a long way to go with diversity across the board, including racial diversity.  While I hope those issues get tackled individually, I think it is important that when we talk about gender diversity, we expand the conversation beyond white, middle/upper class, straight women.  We should be sensitive to how diversity issues impact women of color or LGBTQ women, whose experience across various demographic groups may create unique hurdles and barriers that straight, white, and CIS-gendered women do not experience.  I don't think you can talk about diversity without recognizing intersectionality, and I hope those nuances continue to be part of the conversation at XXX.  ",Emf_BP_Imp,Other,,,
"Gender disparity happens at higher levels in the company. There are not enough women in leadership. The culture is at times hostile or dismissive of women in leadership positions. Women delay childbirth out of fear of being ""mommy tracked"" and then do not have quality healthcare to receive fertility treatments",G_L_D_H,WE_L_Cul,,,
I've never seen any issue with this.,,,,,
"There is a significant need to develop women at the leadership level. I am embarrassed at our company for perpetuating the ""boys club"" culture for so long. ",G_L_D_H,WE_MA,,,
"There is a joke that the C-suite level is an ""all boys club"" and does not seem welcoming for women leadership at that level. Too much emphasis on promoting from within instead of looking for true women leaders outside of the company.  ",WE_MA,CA_PO_U,,,
"The right policies and programs to elevate women are important, but the critical element XXX lacks is trust that the senior leadership team is truly honest in their commitment to women as valued and equal members of the team at every level. SLT's actual attitude is revealed when male SLTs interrupt and talk over or condescend to female directors, pay extra attention to associates in their 20s, ""mansplain"" or otherwise condescend to older women the way they do to their moms, and other interactions deeply familiar to any woman. We're busy, we're focused, and we don't have time for or interest in putting up with that crap. We'd rather go somewhere else if we encounter it too often. ",WE_Tst.iss_status,Effd_GD&GE,,,
"To date, it does not seem as though executive leadership is committed to gender diversity.  Despite several years of discussing the lack of female in leadership, there has been little movement, which has perpetuated a number of significant female departures are the leadership level.",G_L_D_H,,,,
Very few women at Executive Director and above levels; those who were there didn't last long,G_L_D_H,N_G_keep_H,,,
"I think there are a lot of people in the company at fairly high-level positions that understand what gender diversity is about, but senior leadership definitely DOES NOT. It's pretty amazing how smart senior leadership is, but at a deeper intuitive level, really doesn't get it, even if they say they do. SM was great at talking about bring your whole self to work, and I really believed that he wanted that, but it was obvious his privilege and busy schedule was keeping him from really ""getting it"" and  no one from HR or his friends tried to educate him it seems?",G_L_D_H,N_G_ware_D_Imp,,,
"Gender diversity starts out ""okay"" in the product organization but quickly drizzles out after the Manager promotion. When I started, the developers were exclusively men. This has gotten better in Austin as additional mid-level technical women have been added. However, there is no company-wide women in tech mentoring program and the ability to develop early talent into female architects is non-existent.",G_L_D_H,Impv_GD,,,
I find XXX to be very supportive about gender diversity - more so than anywhere else I have ever worked.,N_G_L_D,,,,
"There are many strong female leaders in my division but (up until this week) none at the ELT level, which makes me believe there's a glass ceiling in place and that women at that level would have to leave to advance beyond that point. ",G_L_D_H,CA_Ceil_Fm,,,
"there's a lot of talk at the top about bringing more women to ELT, but NOTHING every happens. I've been here for 2 years and they all say ""it's a priority!"" but clearly it's not, because nothing has changed. ",G_L_D_H,GD_Talk_more_fix_few,,,
"no place to put general comments about the survey itself, so putting them here:  evaluating technical proficiency isn't always appropriate for the job.",None,,,,
There appears to be no gender diversity at the executive leadership level and very little diversity at the leadership level. ,G_L_D_H,,,,
"I've been at XXX for almost 3 years. When I was interviewing at headquarters, I was shown the beer fridge (ugh, I'm a 40 year old woman, who gives a toot??)... and then watched some loudmouth guy walk down the stairs talking on his Bluetooth at the top of his lungs and then watched as everyone parted as if a sea so he could pass (I learned later it was our founder, and also groaned inwardly). So, it's safe to say I knew exactly what I was getting into--and I needed a job, so I took the job.  As a newer employees, I vividly recall being regaled by stories about party-boy behavior that was de facto at Point Lookup at my FORCED and POINTLESS social gabfest/meetings that I had to travel for constantly while trying to juggle over-the-top workloads. (I groaned inwardly at these stories, as they are unsurprising, and I'm too old to care about that crud and was just hoping for a job that I could do well and be left alone to have a life outside of my company that would not required buying into all the ""culture worship"" that is apparently necessary for 20-something bros to work.) I also remember watching a company meeting via WebEx when our founder (thank god he's gone, groan) basically stepped back into the 1980s and blamed women for not advancing themselves in his workplace. I was unsurprised. I ignored it all as much as I could.  Today--only 3 years later, the ""special sauce"" culture at XXX has effectively TOTALLY alienated me from participating (or wanting to participate) in any way with XXX--aside from just doing my damned job well. I like the people I work with on my immediate team, and have just kept my head down in an effort to just get the hell home at 5pm most days. I do like my work, and the kind of projects I do. I just wish I could completely dial down the noise that Watertown loves to create and force me into traveling to ""enjoy"" (sarcasm quotes).  I consider my reaction to be a very normal one for any woman who is confident in her skills and is fully honest with herself after 20+ years of IT jobs. Just leave me alone! Let me do my job! Stop making me stop my life to attend ""trainings"" that are really forced networking that doesn't matter and sucks my soul dry. It's perfectly acceptable to be engaged in your job--and not lust for Pedro's daily.",OTHER,,,,
"This company talks a LOT about the need for diversity.  Talking about it and doing it are completely different.  The fact that women need a mentor or a special program for develop, yet men can just be promoted is appalling.   What is also appalling is when women who are Directors leave (since they have no career path and have been shut down for a higher title), some how men quickly fill their spots and are promoted to Executive Director or above within 6 months or less of being in that role.

"Not only is there a M/F imbalance in the leadership roles, there is also an imbalance in the obvious departments - lots of F in marketing/HR, not so much in the technical departments. With the obvious exception of Dan Haley, white male, who gets to be at the C level over HR with absolutley no HR experience.",G_L_D_H,G_L_D,,,
"There seems to be an unconscious bias towards men in upper level positions (from my limited experience it does not seem intentional, however it is visible that there are less women on the ELT than men). I have not personally experienced any discrimination in terms of career development opportunities. ",G_L_D_H,WE_MA,,,
"I just started working for XXX. When I was interviewing, I was told again and again by female candidates who had left that there is a glass ceiling at XXX.   I shrugged because I'm starting a lower position and don't have to worry about that yet. However, within a few weeks of my employment, a male colleague with both less experience and less relevant experience was promoted over a woman who had been doing that job for a year. Worse, the company chose to relocate the male from India rather than just use a woman who was already doing the job in WAT. It seemed very distasteful and caused a lot of eyebrows to raise in my group composed of mainly women. ",CA_Ceil_Fm,New ,CA_PO_U,CA_Hr_Out,
Its rare to see women growing beyond a senior manager level in XXX. Strong women who came to XXX were forced to leave or they left on their own since the company's culture is not open to gender diversity at the top level.,G_L_D_H,N_G_keep_H,,,

"Although there are more women at this company than those I worked for in the past, I notice there are few above Director. ",G_L_D_H,,,,
"Overall lack of women in leadership positions is a long-standing issue.  When women are in leadership positions, it tends to be in the HR area only.  Also, when people are promoted and coached from within the org, it seems to be men who get the upper hand there.  ",G_L_D,CA_PO_U,,,
"I think XXX is way too focused on blanket statements. Something comes up about our leadership being mostly male, and we jump on this initiative to fill the place with all women. As a women, I certainly would love to see more like me in leadership, but we still need to focus on the right woman for the role.

"In my time here, I have seen both ends of the spectrum in terms of success and discrimination when it comes to gender diversity. Recently, ELT has done exceedingly well recognizing the need to take action with respect to the inclusion of women at all levels. However, in past experiences I've had concerns with the lack of visibility ELT has into lower level people managers when it comes to hiring, equal treatment, and/or promoting women with equivalent and sometimes more experience. The new initiatives sound promising but actions speak louder than words. ",Impv_GD,G_L_D_H,,,

"We talk about the importance of gender diversity but don't actually have programs or action plans to help achieve diversity at all levels. Diversity can also vary wildly from one department to the next.

There is significant cultural change that needs to occur, and that I believe is possible with the right leadership.

XXX works hard to be a flexible company that is understanding of the tough balance of work and life.  However, I think there are roles and situations that require additional work time (whether travel, long hours, etc) and those are minimum requirements of the role.  In those scenarios, each individual needs to determine if that is the right role for them at that time in their life.  Are you able to meet the minimum requirements for the role to be successful?  Seeing female leaders at the top isn't important to me, but trusting in the process that all candidates were evaluated equally and the best person got the job.  That's what matters.",LTE,N_G_L_D,WE_PO_E,Emf_Abb_Imp,

"The leadership team never even acknowledges the fact that female senior executives are short-lived here. Why are they so afraid to admit the problem?

The company has not done a great job speaking to this (e.g., ""not enough women available for senior leadership roles to recruit from"" or ""women at XXX leave before they can get to senior leadership).  These types of messages make it seem as though XXX is not committed to improving this problem. Diversity is crucial to success.",G_L_D_H,,,,

In the past 6 months, over 5 Director-level women have left, many specifically siting lack of career growth and opportunity - fewer chances to get a 'stretch project' where men are offered at a higher rate.  It is scary and demotivating to see most of my role models exit - feeling like I only have a matter of time before I also hit the 'glass ceiling' of Director and need to find a new company to be able to continue to advance.

The real evidence is who you see in all of our leadership roles today.  When a woman does make it into one of these roles, it is very short lived.  I never want to see a woman put in a role just because she is a woman.  I want to see the best qualified people placed in a role regardless of gender but we have had some great women in leadership and their career is always short lived at XXX.  Again, I don't know what the real story is but perception from this end is that all these talks of women in leadership (VP and up) are exactly that, just talk.

"Above the manager cohort women increasingly dwindle in numbers as they approach more leadership positions. There is a culture here that promotes being more aggressive and territorial, jumping quickly-to-action, and stubbornly pursuing one's own vision - things that are more stereotypically male. Things that women exceed at such as collaboration, listening, adaptiveness, and reasoned analysis are not the priority.

"the issue for me is not the gender diversity as I see many women in my department in key positions, but instead a popularity contest for promotion regardless of gender.  It's not a gender issue for promotion, but more of a popularity issue and if one person doesn't like you for some reason your career pathway is done (man or woman).  Most of the ""popularity"" issues are an Atlanta vs. Boston division as Atlanta is further away from larger project hand offs.  Now with the PPO our ability to travel to Boston to take place in hirer project visibility is limiting our input on projects that affect our organization's workflows.",N_G_L_D,WE_bias_Inf_H,WE_L_Eff,,

In my opinion, gender diversity starts with me, and XXX has done a fine job of creating an environment where I feel I can flourish and am supported to overcome roadblocks.  It frustrates me that so many women don't realize that they are often making the world's problems our own.  And I feel that this has been such a hot topic that people end up talking about because it's more 'popular' than 'real'.   Yeah, could we use more Senior female leaders, sure.  And I want to take action against unconscious bias and help women feel as empowered as I do.  But do we know how many qualified women have applied for senior roles?  No, I don't.

"overall, i believe XXX does a good job diversifying its employees. When we start to hit director positions and above I think its male dominated. At Executive levels there are barely any women.

It is painfully obvious that something is broken in the way that XXX hires and advances women by the lack of senior leadership.

"The company has operated as a boys club for so long it's hard to see change happening. Maybe it will be better now that SM and Kyle are gone.

"Lower cohorts are much more diverse from a gender perspective than at the leadership level. While leadership is committed to encouraging gender diversity at all layers across the business, the group often exhibits unconscious behavior that contradicts this. Specifically, leadership decisions can sometimes be made during informal gatherings where women may not be present, or may not feel comfortable asking to join. And within more formal settings, it can sometimes be hard to speak up and/or participate in the dialogue.  In addition to these subtle issues, there's an opportunity to improve our parenting policies to better illustrate to employees that everyone should be treated equally. Right now, paternity leave is significantly shorter than maternity leave - and leave associated with adoption is also shorter. This policy falls well below standards set by leading companies and sends a message that women are still the primary care-givers in a household (which is often not the reality anymore) - and sets the expectation at work that women will be gone longer and/or will have changing priorities upon having children. Subconsciously, this plays a role in how men and women are treated and what's expected of them in the office. I highly encourage the business to extend parental leave so that everyone receives the same benefit.",G_L_D_H,WE_PO_U,,,
"In my personal day to day here, I don't feel like gender diversity is a problem. I have a pretty equal split on my team of men and women. However, looking at my manager's peers and above it is pretty disheartening to see such a small proportion of women. It's hard to picture yourself advancing to that level. I've also seen good women leaders fired pretty often. I'm not sure if it just seems that way because there are already so few of them.
