"As a hiring manager in R&D, I would love to have more diverse teams, and look for opportunities to do that-- I don't need any new ""rules"" to force it.  But, the fact is that our positions are very difficult to fill, hiring pipelines are thin as it is, with fewer women still. Very few women apply for my roles-- making ""rules"" to force it is going to be counterproductive.  Find me candidates to interview, and I will!   ",G_L_D_H,G_few_App_Fm,Others,
"It's bad.  There are very few strong women leaders.  To be clear though, it does not seem like the solution should be to up cohort the ones we have.  I have seen people promote women just because they're women, which does not seem like a good example of equal treatment. Also not sure why we're just limiting to gender diversity- the company on the whole is pretty white-washed. ",G_L_D_H,N_WE__E,Should not promote because of gender only,WE_L_CD
"Belfast is somewhat of an outlier as Women represent a larger percentage of the leadership positions.  The notion that Executive leadership has been a ""boys club"" is true and their attempt to bring in strong female leaders in the past unfortunately hasn't worked out.  I think that had more to do with their professional fit than their gender.  Going forward I worry that we will go rail to rail in terms of balancing out senior leadership.  While diversity only strengthens the team it is also important the right leaders are in the right seats - ensuring that female leaders have the development and opportunities to succeed and be recognized for those successes is important.  This will allow the right individuals to rise rather than force the issue.  The company needs the best leaders steering the ship - first and foremost and finding those individuals should be the priority.  Given the talent at this company, women and men should find a balance at all cohorts if we do it correctly.",WE_MA,Opp_do not think gender diversity it problem,Emph_eff,Ability is more important
It is very apparent that there are no women in the C-suite currently and that previously women in the C-Suite have struggled to integrate with the C-team at that time. It is also very apparent that there are very few female VP's (8? out of ~55?) which is perhaps even more concerning given the number of women in leadership roles at Exec. Dir. level. The three new female members of SLT/ELT is an encouraging sign but some may see it as reactionary. ,G_L_D_H,,,
I can really only speak for my area but there are to few non-male personnel in the department.  ,NONE,,,
"I think XXX has done a good job with gender diversity.  if our stats are correct, 2016 showed women represent 40% of the population in Director and above; however if we look at minority populations, minorities represent only 12%.  We have over rotated on this sensitivity towards comments regarding gender parity and have forgotten that minorities are significantly under represented.  ",WE__L_CD,G_P_D,,
"I am new to the company, but my observation is that everyone is treated and respected equally regardless of position.   ",N_CA_E,New,,
"It is far from what it should be.  Some of that is a function of the tech world, which has become very dysfunctionally imbalanced.  But some of that is that we're not doing as good a job as we can be.  I don't think our recruiters are doing a good job of targeting and working with women-in-tech organizations like ACM-W, Society of Women Engineers (SWE), IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE), and the various student chapters of all of the above.  I'll also note that this survey led with a gender question that had ""male, female, non-binary, other"", which is great, but then every single question was posed as women/men.  Think about the message that that sends.",G_Dis_Def,,,
It bothers me as a male that we do not have more diversity within ELT,G_L_D,,,
We are a very inclusive company. ,NONE,,,
I think we should have greater diversity in our executive ranks. ,NONE,,,
"We have never had many women at the highest levels of the org, especially outside of HR",G_L_D_H,,,
"I've worked for a lot of tech companies and XXX compared to the vast majority is an extremely gender diverse company with many senior leaders. I think that message gets lost a lot, as many other top tech companies have a far lower percentage of female employees never mind minorities. ",N_G_L_D,G_L_D_H,,
I consider XXX to be an incredibly diverse company. The problem is at the ELT level. It is very unclear to me if it's actually a gender issue vs. a political or social issue.  ,N_G_L_D,G_L_D_H,,
this was a weird survey,NONE,,,
I would love to see more women at the executive level,G_L_D_H,,,
"A lot of talk, not enough results.",WE_N_Eff,,,
"My reaction after answering all of these questions is that our time could be better spent elsewhere than a survey and instead just taking practical action - it's almost like you are asking us because you don't know yourself. As a male - my ""I don't know"" for most of these isn't indicative of me not thinking it's a problem nor is it a signal that I lack any empathy - I personally just feel like I can't have an intelligent point of view because I am not a woman and not facing this day in and day out. Point being, I don't know how valuable some of this feedback is.",NONE,,,
Recent actions are big steps in the right direction.  Let's not lose the momentum.  ,NONE,,,
We have work to do. Survey is an interesting thing in that just reading the questions has provoked even more insight for me on how much we have to do to make gender diversity real at XXX.,Impv,,,
This survey is mostly filled in from the point of view of a developer,NONE,,,
"General view is that the company is committed and interested in gender/ethnic diversity, but not sure the results are borne out.  Not sure if that's a lack of execution or lack of qualified candidates.",Other ,not confident with the excution in improving,,
The company is actively trying to balance gender diversity at all levels especially in Sr. Leadership positions where it is lacking. It's hard to answer some questions in this survey because I am not a woman and do not know what their perception is and therefore chose not to rate many questions.,Impv_GD,G_L_D_H,,
"I think we have a lack of women in senior leadership positions.  Not sure of all the reasons, but I know some women have felt uncomfortable here.",G_L_D_H,,,
There appears to be a glass ceiling for women here. The stats bear this out. Very important we figure this out and provide pathways for women to take leadership positions at the company.,CA_PO_U,,,
"I've noticed recently stronger messaging around the need for gender diversity which is a good thing. It is hard to say for a number of these questions if certain programs are set up for women so it would help to have a place to go to see all those available resources, for that matter all employees as well. I wouldn't be surprised if it exists but perhaps repetitive communication would help. ",Impv_GD,,,
"There are very apparent examples of inequities as it pertains to women advancing their careers and having opportunities to break into leadership roles. Engineering is also very male-dominant, which may not have been by designed...but we need to recognize and have a vision (with a supporting strategy) to address it and stop just throwing ideas at it.",G_L_D,,,
Definitely could do with more diversity in the C-suite.,G_L_D_H,,,
I like the diversity goals we have as a company,G_L_D,,,
"gender diversity is pretty good at XXX as a whole, but not so in OOCTO",N_G_L_D,G_L_D_H,,
"SLT does not seem to be equipped to actually deal with gender diversity or the challenges of having a diverse workplace.  Here are some examples:  Marc Levine - Responded to questions about unconscious bias in our bonus strategy by telling the company that they would ""deal"" with anyone exhibiting conscious bias.  Missed the point or completely doesn't understand unconscious bias.  Dan Haley - Has blamed women who have left for our lack of diversity.  Appears to link results as opposed to root causes.  The rest have not actually taken a stance on diversity in an public forum and tend to let the above members carry the day, which saddens me.",N_G_L_D,,,
Overall I believe we are ahead of most orgnaizations.,NONE,,,
I've never seen a company that more encourages diversity!,N_G_L_D,,,
"Without senior (SVP,EVP) women leaders, we have a huge gap between what we say and do.",G_L_D_H,,,
we need more female leaders and executives at XXX - period. the company talks a good game and says all the right things but it just doesn't deliver on its promise. ,G_L_D_H,,,
