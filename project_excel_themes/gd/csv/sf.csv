There is no pipeline problem. There are enough women who are smart and have potential that are alienated by what was formerly a very dysfunctional leadership team. What's inherently difficult about the advancement of women in general is that the fact that being successful in the workplace is an idea that operates directly in conflict with what it takes to be a successful woman, as defined by society. There are MANY things that we do well here (especially in some pockets of the company), like maternity leave or being flexible, but there are also other places where we could do better - like paternity or in general encouraging men to do more the 'emotional labor' that comes with existing in the workplace.  re: Paternity - every single day that a man does not have the same time available to him to get to know his new child, gender stereotypes that men are supposed to be successful 'outside the home' and women are 'inside the home' are reinforced.",GD_Talk_more_fix_few,CD_down.est,WE_PO_U,

I find that most of the non-men that work here are concentrated in specific roles, while roles like software development and anything in the R&D org are very male dominated.

To your knowledge, are there non-binary folks on your team, in your building, org, etc.? I feel this is in important because as a member of the small group sales team, I feel we don't even have any non-binary folks among us and I may entirely be wrong, but that probably speaks volumes about the culture we have--do these folks feel comfortable expressing their gender and bringing their full selves to work or in an organization of 100+ people, do we have a culture that hires only cis males and females?",OTHER,,,

Also for anyone, even men, it is so obviously wrong in this day and age to have an all-white, all-male, completely non-diverse leadership team; anyone with half a brain knows that's not smart, as the best decisions can only be made with a variety of perspectives. So it makes all of us, not just women, lose faith in this company.  In addition to leadership desperately needing more women and diversity in general, my particular role (software developer) is also in great need of gender equality. It is still far too often the case that males make up all or 4/5 of a scrum team. This is absolutely unacceptable. It makes the single woman on the team feel completely alone with no female peer to relate to. I can say from personal experience that after too long like this you start to doubt whether you should even be a developer at all because you don't see any other developers who look or think like you do.

There is a lot of diversity here.,N_G_L_D,N_WE_L_Cul,,
"I think gender diversity at XXX is wonderful until you look at the highest levels of senior leadership, where it is noticeably lacking",G_L_D_H,,,
Executive Leadership at XXX feels like the good old boys club.,WE_MA,,,
"We are all aware of the stats, the higher-up the less women. I believe XXX's reputation has been that it is ""sexist"" on top. I have heard this even before working here. I believe the company wants to have a better reputation regarding gender diversity but has not taken actions to achieve it (till now). It shouldn't end with surveys. I really would like to see more women be promoted or hired into leadership roles. I believe right now given the opportunity of the CEO position being open, it would mean so much for so many to see a qualified woman take the title.",G_L_D_H,G_Dis_Def_H,GD_Talk_more_fix_few,WE_PO_U
I think we do have an adequate amount of gender diversity at the company,N_G_L_D,,,
"It is very obvious that in any sales division outside of Small Groups Sales, there are zero women in leadership roles (Director or above).",G_L_D,DEPARTMENT,,
"There appears to be plenty of gender diversity in the lower cohorts, but the executive level lacks female leaders.",G_L_D_H,,,
general comment about this survey is that I didn't realize it was send out until a colleague of mine told me what to look for in my inbox.  I think this could have been sent out by a familiar name and should have had a simpler subject line.,,,,
"There seem to be a lot of women at XXX, but almost all of the senior leadership are men.",,,,
I don't see any difference in how men and women are treated at my level.  Treated equally as we should be.  Thank you.,,,,
"All you have to do is look around, and notice that our senior leadership is white men.  We need to have the same diversity we have in the associate/manager level be also at the very top. ",,,,
I'd like to see a gender balanced SLT. ,,,,
"The company is over 50 percent women. That statistic speaks for itself. That being said, there is a lack of diversity in the Director level and above. ",,,,
"There aren't enough women in the ELT. Our leaders always say that they are committed to bringing more women into the highest levels of leadership, but that would mean one of the men preaching those words would need to give up their spot to a woman. ",,,,
"it doesn't seem that many women are hired into leadership positions, and even fewer are retained",,,,
"My team is primarily women but the men seem to receive the most high-profile projects despite the fact that women in similar positions are equally as competent.  Lots of ladies at XXX, but I feel like I have seen guys in senior associate roles who are not nearly as competent as some of their female associate counterparts.  Why did they get promoted at all? ",,,,
Gender Diversity seems to break down past Sr. Leadership positions. ,,,,
Operations has a high percentage of female employees and is at the low end of the salary range.,,,,
I am too new to know and I work from home.,,,,
"XXX has been discussing this issue for years and nothing has changed.  women were surveyed abt 6 years ago on working conditions in terms of women getting promoted above say manager or  a few to director and nothing has changed, except there is a diversity dashboard where u can see the actual stats. same story  years later.   Feels like   old boys network /frat  boy cuture in some depts.     ",,,,
"Gender diversity does not exist at XXX. Even with women in management positions you'll see that these are in areas of ""support"", not technical, and usually in organizations that are more dismissed than more male dominated groups (i.e. CSC vs Product)",,,,
XXX is consistently providing communication regarding gender diversity at the workplace. They are being as transparent as they can. ,,,,
"It varies by cohort level and zone. Dev and R&D fail to attract females, while operations are mostly females. More than gender diversity, I'm concerned with age diversity. You do not see a lot of employees past their 40, and older employees, especially females are rarely promoted.",,,,
Would like to know more about what is being done to make the company more gender diverse.,,,,
"Being only a senior analyst I really was unable to answer some of the questions asking if certain options were available to women. It seems as if those would be available for those in senior leadership roles and above and the communication to those is not available to us on the ""lower levels"". I really feel that this survey would have been better off filled out from leadership up as the questions seemed mostly around those roles and what was available to them.",,,,
"Overall gender diversity, at least on the female/male binary, seems ok from a pure numbers perspective. But the lessening presence of women through cohorts has been disheartening since I got here. I do think ELT has finally come around to at least putting time towards this problem (I still remain unconvinced that they all actually care about the problem), which I'm grateful for. But time and energy only gets us so far; action, e.g. promoting Jessie Collins and Lorraine Townsend Vargas into SVP roles and having them join ELT, is the only way those gaps in gender diversity will be closed.",,,,
"I think gender diversity is something that needs improvement at the company, but I am happy to hear that this is something ELT is concentrating on.",,,,
I personally believe that women have all the same opportunities as men and it is on them to work hard to get there. I think we put too much emphasis on trying to make it a women friendly work environment when it already is. If some people worked as hard at their jobs as they do pushing a women friendly work environment they might reach their goals and the opportunities available. ,,,,
Lots of statistics around gender diversity are high level vs. looking at technical positions alone.,,,,
I am very happy to see so many women added to the ELT -- and sorry it took the recent mess for it to finally happen. Let's keep on this!,,,,
I believe there is a good diversity in the company. Surveys like this are aggravating because it leads people to believe this is not the case. If you want true equality between men and women then special programs for women lead you to believe that women are not equal and need special programs to advance. Why make programs geared to one gender but have them open to all? ,,,,
n/a,,,,
I have never thought we didn't have gender diversity at XXX. ,,,,
I don't have any knowledge of any issues,,,,
I think it is very diverse. ,,,,
Executive level leadership at XXX is dominated by white men and has been since i have been with the company. ,,,,
"Fantastic diversity here. Never seen or heard of any issues. Very positive workplace no matter your age, race, gender.",,,,
"We constantly hear that diversity is important to leadership at XXX. That said, we currently have zero female SVP's or above.",,,,
There seems to be equal amounts of male and female managers at least.,,,,
No advancement within this company or mentoring programs for women of color  (especially African Americans women). We barely get respect in our roles. ,,,,
"If a woman has to make a presentation with men present in the room, comments are made by men to derail or in some cases completely interrupt her presentation. A women's presentation is essentially treated as unimportant by men here, particularly men in leadership roles.",,,,
"We need more consistent gender diversity across all levels at XXX - right now, we only have it in the lowest levels of the company. Therefore, leadership is not representative of the population it serves which creates mistrust, unhappy employees, and decisions that do not reflect the people they impact the most.",,,,
"While a significant percentage of the staff cohort (senior associate and below) is comprised on women, that number steadily decreases as cohorts move up. While some of this can be attributable to women opting to leave the workforce in lieu of childcare responsibilities, compared to other companies XXX does have very flexible work from home policies, generous paternity/maternity leave, and it offers a good work-life balance (people usually work ~40 hours a week). Considering this, I find it hard to believe all the women that failed to progress from senior associate to management and above is due primarily to women leaving the work force. Female representation at XXX at the management and above level is not equal, and XXX loses top female talent because of it. ",,,,
" It was refreshing to see female leaders added to the executive leadership team.  Let's keep that up!  As a female, it is disheartening to look at your leaders and they are all men.  It would also be great to see more female leaders in OOCTO, specifically.  ",,,,
"The higher the management level, the worst the gender diversity.",,,,
I think it is absurd that we are taking a survey regarding gender diversity.,,,,
"At the Staff and Immediate Management level, I am please with the gender diversity I see at my day-to-day job. However, at the EVP level and above there is a disconcerting amount of women representation.",,,,
I have answered I don't know to most of the questions due to: I have been with the company for 1 month and I work remotely. I am not in the office environment to answer the questions any other way at this time.,,,,
"I would say there is gender inequality when it comes to positions in R&D-DEV. For the members of technical staff, there are far more men than women.  XXX would do well to hire more female developers. ",,,,
"Most of the times, it seems like the majority of women are clustered in the Manager or below tiers, with fewer and fewer making it above that level.  ",,,,
This is non existing with all leadership roles. As well as ethnic diversity.,,,,
"This survey was a complete miss on identifiable questions- This survey should have dug deeper and not asked only Director (leadership) and above questions. It should have been holistic to ALL cohorts. ""Staff"" (Sr Assoc, Assoc, Analyst, Rep) are the ones that suffer the MOST not having the growth opportunity and support!  ",,,,
I feel this should have no baring on how well an employee does their job. I have always thought the best person for the job (man or woman) is the one who gets the job. It should not be based on how many woman verses how many men do the job better. ,,,,
Lack of gender diversity at the leadership and executive levels has a significant impact on the culture of the company. Women do not feel that we have a path upward beyond Senior Manager/Director.,,,,
"I feel that my current team treats all team members equally, both with performance reviews and advancement opportunities. My prior team did not, and it was very obvious that you were not going to advance unless you were a man, or willing to participate in ""boys club"" activities. The manager in my prior department is well known for this habit. Its been called to the attention of the department manager, whose response was that someday he would need to be replaced if he's ever to promote and he couldn't do anything about the biased behavior, because the person committing it was the only person qualified to replace him.",,,,
Gender diversity in SLT is disappointing for women at XXX. Having diverse leaders show staff that they can succeed. ,,,,
Just wanted to note that Bret has really communicated his desire to see change in this area and I believe that he will be able to make progress in that area.,,,,
"We have a huge issue with gender diversity in leadership and also a large issue with gender diversity in software development roles.  There are almost no female role models high in the company hierarchy.  As a separate issue, there are also huge gaps for people of certain racial/ethnic backgrounds across all roles and leadership structure.  Additionally, though, the fact that this survey is being sent out seems like a positive step in the direction of increasing gender diversity awareness and action.",,,,
"Alot of talk, very little action. The company hides behind ERGS, strong women leadership has been fleeing, without response from senior leadership",,,,
There are currently many women in Director roles and below but that number significantly drops above the director level. ,,,,
when will we see a survey about the lack of diversity in leadership regarding other races/ethnicities? Diversity is more than just about women. ,,,,
There has been a total lack of gender diversity in leadership and I find this troubling. ,,,,
I perceive that there are more women being led by men than there are men being led by women (looking at the staff and manager levels),,,,
Statistically there is almost NO diversity in the most powerful positions - this points to deeper problems that are not being addressed. There are probably many reasons why these problem exist but the company should try to tackle them with every possible solution available. ,,,,
"The lack of women in top leadership positions is the biggest issue we face. I have not felt that the executive leadership team even saw this as a problem until recently, when outside publicity forced them to start making some statements. There is tremendous opportunity for actions here - widening the circle replacing SM direct reports is a great first step. ",,,,
"It is clear that the ""boys club"" SLT of SM's day had a trickle-down effect on other leadership, and it will take some time and mindfulness from SLT to hire a more diverse senior leadership team to help shape XXX in a more positive and accountable manner.",,,,
"Male or female, I honestly just want the best and most qualified candidate in the appropriate role. ",,,,
"It's really disturbing that none of our executive leaders are women. We've had woman executive leaders in the past, but I know at least one high-ranking female leader quit due to sexual harassment. XXX talks a lot about gender diversity and wanting to help women--but the executive leaders don't walk the walk. Seems to me they want to preserve the old boys' club.",,,,
Women to men ratio in team is not equal causing gender issues like women not being able to convey their opinion in team meetings.,,,,
"It doesn't appear to me that on the Collector team there's much gender diversity in leadership. It often seems like teams are being led by men when there are women in the same team who are equally if not more capable of managing the team - but happen not to have as much experience.   XXX talks a lot about diversity but given that hiring processes for a lot of teams are decentralized and teams need backfills quickly, the gender diversity of the team often gets overlooked.   ",,,,
There isn't much gender diversity in the higher management.,,,,
The number of men in executive/leadership roles severely outweighs women.,,,,
Gender diversity in OOCTO is really bad. Especially women of color vs white men. ,,,,
