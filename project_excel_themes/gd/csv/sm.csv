Staff - Male
never really thought it was an issue. I see a lot of women in  management. I hope XXX is promoting people based on performance not just one specific gender because their percentage isn't quite equal..
I think that XXX is a well balanced company with growth for everyone.
"Honestly, tired of hearing about it. Actions speak louder than words. We already have a very diversified gender employee count. I honestly see more women than men working at XXX health already. Pushing the matter further can very possibly bring just as many harmful effects as good ones. Hiring based solely on gender is automatically discriminatory to all genders. You cannot hire without hurting someone if it's only gender based. Merit and integrity should be all that matters.  "
In my department we have way more women than men. I don't think gender plays a role in promotion or evaluation of opportunity. I've only reported to a female manager and female director. I've never heard anyone say they feel discrimination based on gender. 
"I can only speak to the BEL office. I've had seven different managers. Five of those instances were women.  I do not feel there were any biases towards me from any of my managers due to my gender, nor do I feel that conversations with anyone in management were catered to me in a certain way because I'm a man.  I will say in all honesty I feel I tend to accomplish more with female managers as the conversations I have are more professional and about work, less about our personal lives."
It's fine
I want diversity of thought instead of some arbitrary spectrum of how people define themselves. 
"I've been here less than six months, but from what I've seen, gender diversity is pretty good -  but that's looking at people, not their positions. I don't know how diverse given areas or levels might be."
I think it is unfortunate that as a society we make it about gender and not about the ability and availability of the employee to do the job being provided by the employer.
"Being from BEL, I have never seen an issue with gender diversity as the majority of employees and leaders on this campus are women."
"Although there was a demographic question about non-binary genders, the whole tone of this survey made it abundantly clear that this survey and the company using the information are deeply embedded in a binary gender mindset.  Not one question dealt with non-binary issues."
"When hiring, as an associate it can be difficult to assess the diversity of the applicant pool after it has been filtered by the recruiter and the hiring manager. This can make it hard to tell if a pool of mainly male applicants is a result of who applied or a result of bias."
"It feels weird to me that we're pushing for gender diversity. Shouldn't we be pushing for gender equality? Why are we focusing specifically on women's work environment when we should be focusing on everyone's work environment? No one should be treated differently. How come men only get 6 weeks of paternity leave while women get 12?   My department and leadership are almost all women. My team is currently 6 men, 40~ women and the leadership team is 9 women out of 13. That to me is specifically because the women were well qualified to be managers and I don't view it as a sexist issue. The male managers were also highly qualified. All of the managers are respectable, respectful and fantastic leaders.   There is a prevelant issue being voiced by both genders that career development isn't evident and the paths can be cloudy, and I know that the XXXU has been driving to change that, but there should be more focus on that. Both advancements, developments should be gender neutral because everyone should be treated the same and raised up based on merit and ability (drive, passion etc). "
It's very important for sure.  I tend to fell it will make us a stronger organization. I also feel that it's not always a positive move to just promote people due to there gender.
Everyone at XXX health is treated as equals.
"The overall feeling to me seems that women write their own ticket here and there are so many tools available to help them, while I am held back because i was born male and white."
Our executive leadership team is still almost entirely men. As are technical roles.
"Obviously in Tech it's not as strong as it could be, but in Collector is feel very strong."
"At the Associate level, there appears to be plenty of diversity. There are teams with more men or more women and there are teams with a 50/50 mix. While this ground-level feels like it has good diversity, leadership is primarily men. Diversity at the leadership level is especially important yet appears to be mostly lacking. The mentality that we ""hire the best person for the job"" ignores the role of diversity and sets the sail for the ship independent of whatever leadership might say otherwise. I also see most of the opportunities coming out of HR and through my manager, giving me the perception that leadership is not actually promoting these programs but allowing them. I am generally proud of the progress this company is making, but I feel like it is due to our employee-led groups much more so than leadership."
"i think we are making good headway into balancing the gender culture at XXX. Though I think we have a way to go, and that it will never be ""gender-blind"" especially given the current socio-political climate around gender."
"In my org we have several women directors and executive directors. I have only ever had female managers. To be very frank....this all seems like a massive course over correction. I respond, engage with and look up to a manager, director, ED, VP, SVP, C level REGARDLESS of gender. Isn't that the true meaning of equality?"
"I should start by saying that my perspective is largely speculative, but based on my experiences as an LGBT employee and extrapolated from there. I get the sense that the company is, on paper, very committed to gender diversity, but I don't see those thoughts and policies turn into actions. The ELT does a good job preaching about what should be done and change, but I don't see that trickle down into leadership (director level) actionably"
"XXX tries to be gender diverse. But it appears their strategy is to load technical team with men, then have non technical teams filled with women. This gives the appearance that XXX is diverse from a high level, but truly it is not."
"People should be hired and promoted based on character, intelligence, and kindness. Gender, color, cultural background, sexual orientation, and anything else people use to separate us from each other should be a non-issue. It's about celebrating diversity while recognizing the commonality we all share."
"This survey wasn't really about gender diversity, which is a worthy topic.  It was about the experience women have at XXX, which is another worthy topic.  The introduction include this ""This survey focuses on gender diversity issues ..."", yet almost all the questions where about women.  What does it say about XXX the we confuse these two important issues?  If we are concerned about gender diversity, where is the concern for (pardon my inept language here) non-traditionally binary genders?  If we are concerned about gender diversity, where is the concern for getting men into roles that are typically dominated by women?  So, my comment about gender diversity is that we need to separate the gender diversity conversation from the advancement of women conversation.  Both worth our time and energy, but different."
"How does one go about answering these questions? If I'm a man I have no idea if X, Y and Z are more difficult or less difficult for someone of another gender."
"I believe the greatest opportunity for improved gender diversity is at the leadership level, both of my product zone and the company. It is important for women and non-binary individuals to be able to look up the org-chart and see at least someone similar to them, and I find it difficult to believe that there were no qualified women candidates for any of the open leadership positions over the last year or two."
"The higher up you go, the less diverse it is, dramatically."
I would like to see more All Gender bathrooms to support current and future non-binary and trans employees. 
"It would be nice to see more information regarding both women AND men, and the choices and career paths thereof while within the company.  It is near impossible to know the impact of the programs for women if employees are not granted access to the data surrounding career advancement based on gender."
"The best way I can sum it up - there's a lot of talk and some walk. Doing the walk, what I've seen, is harder than the actual talk especially when it comes to things such as this. As much as some people may say that it's not enough, it's far better than what I've seen other organizations attempt."
"I think XXX already provides an environment where gender diversity has been accomplished.  Further push to hire or  promote people based on their gender is the same kind of discrimination, in my opinion."
For my particular team there are many more female leaders and higher positions held by females.  We have about 15% male presence on our team.  
"I think everyone agrees it's very important, but are struggling to execute. In R&D it seems like once women are here they have similar opportunities to advance at least through the first few levels, but we struggle to get them in the door to begin with. That may be different than the experience in other parts of the company."
"With my own personal experience, women at XXX have been my mentors and have become very good friends the 4+ years I have been working at XXX. During this time, socially in our country the topic of gender equality and equal pay between genders has become a hot button issue and has crossed over into the workplace. I will not bring up these topics in conversation at work because I believe the topic has no influence on my day to day tasks and is a very awkward conversation I have overheard (but stay out of) during working hours. I feel a lot of stories that we have all seen and been exposed to on the news makes its way into the workplace and puts a negative stigma on a lot of males within the workplace, which results in males feeling the need to always make their positions known that they do not tolerate and they condone ones behavior. Every employee goes through a background check before being hired at XXX and we have a certain type of employee we look for (optimistic, excited, energetic) and for us as a company to start second guessing each other based on others' actions (who do not work at XXX) seems silly to me. Over the past few years our culture has changed and I believe it has changed for the worse because we are constantly reminded through e-mails and the Commons of this gender gap. One positive that we have going is the different outlets we have for gender specific groups (Women's Leadership Forum) which helps and has a great message and cause, but at the same time there are no groups for males (I don't believe). This is where as a company we could go down a slippery slope of promoting one gender and not treating genders as equal. And since we are having these socially hot button topic conversations on a regular basis here at XXX, I'm afraid that this only leads to stereotyping, which is the opposite of what this whole campaign attends to achieve."
"XXX has a great diversity of gender across the company as a whole, but I feel that the OOCTO has to make strides in improving gender equality among recruitment and advancement."
Hoping for more women in senior leadership positions!
"XXX has a very diverse staff at lower levels, but executive levels are still mostly men"
"It seems that there is a large amount of gender diversity in lower roles, but not a lot in SLT "
"I feel like people have equal opportunity here at XXX. Despite male or female, PEOPLE have equal opportunity in this work environment. "
More women than men work at XXX. 
"The company talks the talk, but the numbers don't necessarily show that it walks the walk. The demographic breakdown seems to get more male the higher in the ranks you go."
"I personally do not hear about gender diversity issues often. If they do exist, I think there should be a community-led initiative to voice the opinion of those within the company. Sometimes when initiatives around topics like gender diversity are pushed from the top with little context as to where it is coming from, it can feel like there is a disconnect."
"Gender is fairly balanced across the company, but I think that belies the fact that a lot of our operations people are female, as well as our POs, but that women are not very well represented in development and leadership in general."
"Not a single question on this survey had anything to do with HIRING WOMEN, and I think that's pretty indicative of the problem."
"we don't shut up about how much we care about this, so thats at least good"
I think this survey is ridiculous. It further divides people rather than bring them together. People should be promoted on merit.  Sex should not have a role.  Women should not be given more coaching or opportunity than men and vice verse.
Survey was tough to complete accurately because I notice very different things within austin office vs generally
"Could be better for its trans employees. More gender inclusive bathrooms, having a company-wide mandatory pronoun field on the IDs underneath the name, tampons and pads in the mens bathroom, etc."
"I think diversity in a workplace is important to get differing opinions and perspectives, and in general that teams who are diverse not only in gender but also age, cultural background, etc. can greatly improve the outcome of projects. Specifically related to the gender gap, I think it's harder to have a R+D department that is evenly split male/female because that doesn't reflect the split in the workforce (check out the latest stack overflow developer survey for example). While I think it is important to hire people to create diversity, I would caution against the pendulum swinging so far the other way that we end up hiring inferior developers because they check off diversity checkboxes"
"I marked a number of questions ""Do not know"" because I didn't really feel qualified to answer. For some I made an educated guess based on conversations I've had on related subjects though.  I think an important distinction to make is SLT assertions versus action/reality. There are a lot of attestations made about our policies regarding gender diversity, but the reality of the matter tells a different story (80% male in OOCTO according to our diversity dashboard). I think it's important to have numbers available (like with the diversity dashboard) and to have a consistent and constant message about gender diversity, but acting to make improvements is another matter and I don't think we're doing a good enough job on that. Most of our new hires are men, so we are not moving that 80/20 split towards parity."
"In marketing, the vast majority of employees are female, so my perspective may be a bit skewed. Generally. I am surrounded by many high-powered and well-respected women. Gender diversity in marketing is excellent, tough to say from my perspective company-wide (though I know that it needs improvement in some orgs adjacent to mine -- sales, CS, etc.)"
ES group has a large group of women in leadership
I think we're pretty diverse up until we get to the engineering org and the executives at the company. 
Would love to see this survey more inclusive to other genders beyond the binary male and female. 
I see lots of discussions and happenings about promoting gender equality
"I work in a performanced based field - sales. I want the best BEST best person to be on my team and managing me (woman, man, robot, ect). Diversity at the expense of performance should not be a goal"
"I feel like XXX has a fairly good gender balance at the associate to manager level. But above that, it skews pretty heavily towards male. Talking to previous female coworkers, it is frustrating to see many higher roles filled by males; and in the few instances where a female does fill the role, they don't stay long. "
"My hope is that the company as a whole is not making hiring, promotional, and business decisions based on gender.  It seems as though all both women and men have the same opportunities and are offered the same opportunities within the company, from my perspective as a male. Therefore, I answered many of the questions concerning woman's mentoring programs and leadership/project opportunities as not gender specific, as the company has offered many non-gender specific opportunities that are not gender exclusive.  "
"Within development, we have a very poor gender ration, and it gets worse higher up the career ladder. This is a problem. At the same time, a higher proportion of my role models are women than the overall ratio. This suggests that we women we have are incredibly competent and talented when compared to the men, who are at times mediocre. That, plus the declining ratio of women at higher levels, suggests to me that our evaluations of potential hires and potential promotions is biased against women in a way that, one average, values them lower than men, whether because of the processes we use or the people who make that process happen."
"Gender diversity in OOCTO is very low. This is a general issue with programming/development/computer operations  in the industry, but I feel XXX is in a better place to address this than many other companies."
"Personally I do not have much insight into this.  As far as job split is concerned, what I see on a day to day basis, women comprise more of the workforce for the company then men."
The development organization at XXX appears to have a dismal ratio of women to men and has become drastically worse since I started (because losing 2 or 3 people was a massive % of the total). I don't know how this compares to the industry at large but the industry at large is in bad shape in this respect so I don't think it's unreasonable to hold ourselves to a higher standard.
"Things seem fine on the ground floor, but look at the composition of the SLT!  Something is rotten."
In my experience women and men are treated as equals through all facets of the organization. I have actually seen the inverse where women were promoted due to personal relationships not just merit
"Gender diversity is remarkably low in technical fields, and while I recognize this may be a result of the skew of the applicant pool, the company needs to find ways to appeal to a broader audience and add some gender diversity to the room of men that fill OOCTO meetings."
gender diversity in Belfast could be improved. There is a lack of men in several departments. Authorization Management in Belfast has a severe lack of male management which has promoted a culture of male suppression. 
I feel as though we are diverse.
"There is very clearly a bottleneck that forms once you pass the manager cohort. Women are hired for entry positions at a higher rate, than they are for leadership positions. "
"I sometimes feel there is a lack of focus on who is the most qualified for lower-to-mid-level promotions and feel like it is more about gender diversity than qualifications, at times"
It feels like the recent promotion of women to the ELT is more of a reaction to the news about SM. I am hoping I am wrong about that and these deserving women were on track for promotion regardless.
"Promoting gender diversity is part of the culture at XXX. We have an employee-run diversity council that promotes conversation of gender and race. That said, it still feels like there are some departments that are extremely skewed when ti comes to gender."
"Senior leadership has stated their desire to have an inclusive an diverse company. However, many times, that feels like ""talk."" This is especially true based on comments from the recently departed CEO (who at one point made a comment implying we weren't going to hire someone just to fulfill a diversity quota). I am cautiously optimistic that the new leadership in place will put action behind their words and truly work to encourage diversity across the company --from SLT to analyst."
"There are plenty of women above me - managers, supervisors, and directors.   If you want to know what attracks high performing women, please go ask high performing women."
Gender diversity at XXX is probably the best that I've seen from a standpoint of feeling surrounded by an equal share of men and women peers.  
"The gender diversity of the general population of XXX is pretty healthy, but as you go up the chain of command, the scale tips heavily towards me. Therefore, I can't trust leadership completely when they say that gender diversity matters: they're talking the talk but not walking the walk."
"I would like to see more senior female leadership. I would also like to see more female developers. In UX I think we have a great mix of genders, but not of ethnic diversity. We should also focus on that because its pretty poor. "
Women in engineering roles seem better represented than many tech companies.
"As a man, it is hard for me to answer a number of these questions because I do not have the same experiences as the women which is why a number of my answers were in the do not know category."
"The glass ceiling exists, it sucks.. XXX has not shattered it. I think it's time to start looking at what we have been doing and pull back from our current path and find a new one"
"There are only 2 genders, pandering to individuals slows down progress of the overall group. "
"I feel it is fine in all honesty. It seems like 75% of the employees are women. Also, a large amount of those women are in leadership roles. "
"This survey feels very oriented towards womens situations and issues which I don't feel I have any insight or awareness into the companies demographics around diversity.  While I believe that women do face discrimination in pretty much any area compared to men, I don't feel that men are on equal footing either.  Minorities and any other demographic tend to be underrepresented and undercompensated.  "
"I'm the only male on my team and my manager identifies as female, so I'm not certain how typical my experience is of the company as a whole. Because I am a man, not in a managerial position, and at the company for a relatively short (and tumultuous) time, there were many questions I did not feel qualified to answer. "
"In r&d, it seems that there are whole products without any female voices at all.  I worked on a team with no women for a year and a half before we finally hired one.  She is the only one that has been on that team since."
"in my 30 year career, XXX has more women than any other place I have worked on the engineering teams, there are a few more women than in previous jobs this is a good start"
It is encouraging to hear the discussion of gender diversity and to know executive leadership is cognizant of the need for it.
"I don't think we have enough gender diversity (specifically I don't think we have enough women) in the ranks of engineers/developers/""members of technical staff"". Moreover I think we should intentionally try to balance the gender ratios of scrum teams better."
"As is the case with virtually any minority demographic, gender diversity plateaus at a certain point in the hierarchy--a hierarchy which is overwhelmingly predominantly straight white men at the top."
I know that at least one woman was prepared to leave the company if SM didn't leave. People might underestimate how little tolerance there is for senior leaders who do these sorts of things.
We have a good number of women in my org (as developers) but they are poorly represented in leadership.  I think this is why they eventually leave.
I think the notion that men at this company are reluctant to higher or promote women because they are women is frankly absurd and without any factual basis. I think it's reasonable that we are supplied with some evidence of discrimination at XXX before asking us to support these initiatives. 
"I don't consider gender to be male of female, I believe that gender is beyond sex. Overall, I feel that the overall gender diversity is great here. I have never worked in a place where is feel so openly welcome being a gay male. "
"From my perspective here in Belfast, the majority of employees are women. So I don't necessarily agree that there is gender balance. In fact, I'm on a team of 15 people, and I am the only guy.   Prior to the current role I am in now, I was on a team of 20, with only 3 men.  "
My experience is that there is a significant amount of gender diversity in my reporting structure but it tapers down at higher levels and seems like there is too little gender diversity within our executive team.
"I find that in any given meeting, I'm as likely to be in the minority as a male as I am in the majority, which would indicate to me that among the people I frequently meet with, there is good representation of men and women. However, I do not think that in and of itself having gender parity equates to a ""better"" overall result. Rather, I think ensuring fair, equitable advancement opportunities is more important so that individuals of any gender can attain the roles they deserve."
I easily see equal or greater female influence and opportunity where I work.
"There is a glaring lack of females in the C-suite. For many years, it has been seen as a boys club with an emphasis on partying. "
I believe that the right person for the job should be hired regardless of gender and it should not be a factor.
"I do not feel that gender is as important as competency in your role, although it seems that such a focus and spotlight has been put on gender diversity it threatens to overshadow the accomplishments and accolades of those moving into new leadership roles within the company."
"the company constantly stresses the importance of diversity which to me sounds like the determination to make sure white, straight males don't have as many opportunities despite their qualifications. have to be careful to not move too far in the other direction when trying to be ""inclusive"" and ""diverse"" "
seems to be equal to or better than what I see at meetups and conferences
I noted within my first two weeks that I'd never worked in a environment (IaaS) that was so lacking in female workers and leaders. I would like to see an effort made to bridge that gender gap.
I believe XXX fights hard for gender diversity.
"Seems that in the lower cohorts (director and below), gender diversity is average compared to other tech companies, perhaps slightly better. I don't think there is much diversity at executive leadership levels; it seems that a lot of the women we had there in the past few years have left."
A better balance at the top level of the company is crucial. 
"As a caucasian male, I'll admit that I probably don't think about diversity as much as I should.  That being said, XXX seems as diverse as any company I've worked for, and it's talked about and promoted.  It seems to be a very diversity-friendly company from my perspective."
"I think that my area has a slight majority of people who identify as women, but I'm interested to see the actual figures that come out of this survey. "
"There is an extreme disparity in gender diversity at higher levels at XXX that is highly visible. While this problem is not unique to us we seem to do a lot of recognizing that there is an issue, but then don't do much to remedy the issue."
Staff - Other
It's a problem?  My primary manager is female.  The other two managers in my department are female.  My senior manager is female.  The director in our zone is Female.  75% of my team is female. What am I missing....
Gender has nothing to do with a person's qualifications and history.
"This Survey seems to be under the assumption that there needs to be more opportunities for women. People are people everyone has the same opportunities, I haven't seen a survey come out from a Men's diversity group or as if men feel as if they need a gender specific support group. doesn't seem ""equal"" to me"
"SM was a strong voice at XXX. Unfortunately, his comments about women in leadership was very detrimental. in a beer and bull in December his comments on women choose to have children and stop working and colored folks don't continue their education. "
"There seems to be a fair amount of gender diversity here, but the company is still very segregated in that respect. In particular, it seems most of the developers are men. It would be nice to see more inter-role gender diversity, if that makes sense. It would also be nice to see more trans/non-binary/gender-nonconforming folks!"
"As I took this survey, I realized that I don't know a lot about what upper management is doing to create and maintain gender diversity, and I don't know whether we have mentoring programs for women (or men). More communication from upper management and appropriate people about these programs would help bridge that information gap."
Diversity seems well positioned at XXX outside of the executive suite.
"We should be careful to judge a working population at XXX to the population of potential employees (i.e., hireable) and not the general population of US or even the local population of Watertown or Austin. Those local populations may provide estimates, especially for jobs with lower skill requirements, but for some jobs estimating population of potential hires based off the general population will give a wildly skewed demographic result and necessarily lead to a great amount of bias."
"Focus on hiring the best. Worry less about what genitalia your employees have. The world doesn't work out perfectly cleanly, you won't achieve an exact 50/50 split in all positions through legal means. The only way to do so is through gender quotas, which is discrimination."
"The subject of gender diversity is really weak at XXX. We're now focusing on equality for women, but we're failing to address equality for all genders. Do better, XXX."
don't understand the question
"Communication about gender tends to be highly binary, including this survey, which creates an environment where non-binary people do not feel safe and supported being open with their identity. Additionally, until very recently the senior leadership team was so heavily dominated by white men it created a culture where people preached diversity but the message seemed false and hollow. "
"Please also focus on ethnic and racial diversity. If you look at the diversity dashboard, there's a significant difference in the percent of minorities vs non-minorities who are rated exceeds, as well as the rate of promotions. Meanwhile, that gap for men vs women is basically non-existent.   Most of the ERGs are not intersectional at all. As far as I know, the population of the womens' working groups are almost all white. "
"As the only male on my team, and one of the minority of males in my division, I'm pretty sure we're fine. Can we just get on with the work now please and stop wringing our hands about how unfair it all is?"
"We should be more worried about our customers, who are unhappy."
I am not sure what the reason for this is unless you feel bad your boy SM was busted for being a POS scum bag and it has outed you as condoning his bad behavior
"I believe until we stop placing labels on humans, we will continue to exclude particular groups.  We should be focused on diversity as a knowledge base rather than a physical race, gender, sexual preference, etc.  Perfect example, until we can have a ""White Guy's Leadership Forum"" and not be looked at cross eyed, we are focused on separating and excluding people based on gender, identity, etc.  And no, I'm not a white guy.  It's just an example of excluding particular people based on any physical/tangible label is polarizing.  I work with people based on their merits and contributions and strive to encourage them into roles based on their brain/skills, not gender, etc."
"C-level staff present gender equality as ""important for you but not for us"". Gender diversity at this level remains completely absent."
Workplace Environment
Executive - All
"the ""bro culture"" thing is real, but fading fast. "
Leadership - Female
See above. 
"While accommodations exist to support nursing mothers (i.e., ""time out rooms""), schedules are so tight that it is absolutely impossible to take a ""break"" every 2-3 hours to pump.  On top of that, even with perfect planning (which takes time to plan/explain) emergency/mandatory meetings and last-minute assignments often come up throughout the day and require in-person participation (no Webex option), making it impossible to be a nursing mother and continue to perform well at XXX.  Last minute travel (upset clients, prospects, client dinners) and conferences, classes, and events, all of which present career development opportunities, present challenges for nursing mothers and those with child care responsibilities outside of the alread long in-office hours.  "
"I think the overall work environment is good for women.  In my time here, I've been able to maintain a work life balance (some years better than others). What is now tangible, is the positive impact the changes in leadership and org structure within CS, have had.  Things feel calmer, better organized, and straightforward.  Bret isn't interested in politics, buddies or favorites (or promoting employees based on those three things).  He's interested in and focused on business results.  Bret's desire to help develop employees, along with his Directs, feels fair and NOT focused on gender.  I appreciate this wholeheartedly.  Keep up the good work!"
"I personally have only had one manager who struggled to make the overall work environment equal for women and men.  In my 13+ years with the company, generally my managers have always been supportive, flexible, and helped me advance.  In that time I have reported three women, and three men.  One of the men was the one who, at times, made things very difficult and seemed to have separate rules for me vs. the men on my team within the same role."
"General atmosphere of good old boys club...and if female, you have to be part of the club to feel included and advance."
"Women are judged differently in many corners of XXX.     Women are often given feedback to be less emotional and more diplomatic, while men are given recognition for their passion and risk taking.  It's a double standard that needs to stop.   "
"We don't have an inclusive work environment. 1) It's common to hear sexually suggestive and explicit language in the workplace 2) Women are often singled out in private and corporate dialogue -- things as small as ""we're going to turn down the heat in the building, so the women should bring a sweater to the office."" 3) I've also heard what I consider to be really abusive language used in the office. There are a few VPs+ that I've heard directly and indirectly berate employees when disagreeing with an approach/idea/work product (under the disguise of ""unconditional positive regard""). "
"Again, as a female at XXX, I don't see a difference in my work environment compared to that of the men.  People are respectful and helpful regardless of gender.  I hear just as many women making inappropriate comments as I do the men.  And, I would also feel comfortable telling anyone that they're being inappropriate, if I felt uncomfortable with what they were doing or saying.  Maybe it's because I don't have a stick up my ass, but I can take a joke and I don't get offended easily.  If/when someone steps over the line though, I would feel comfortable saying something and wouldn't fear retaliation.  Maybe women at XXX should learn to relax a bit and/or to speak up, not just sit and wait for the next Women in Leadership meeting to vent.  "
"It's getting better.  I have insight into the direct working environment for a small segment (Marketing) and it's actually really good.  But anecdotally, I worry about the lingering frat boy environment in Sales and Product (not sure about CTO)--hopefully, changes in senior leadership will start to change the signals from the top about what's acceptable and what's not acceptable behavior, but that will likely take a cycle or two to take root.  "
"We have a lot of strong women here at XXX, but do not support them going past a certain point. "
"The one area of improvement that I've seen is a commitment to breaking down the ""bro-culture."" Legal and HR have done a great job changing the policies around harassment and reporting harassment. The way that we will take a stand even against inappropriate clients and prospects is encouraging. "
XXX seems like a great place for women to work earlier in their careers. The inability of a woman to succeed long term in the c-suite has hurt the company's brand and perception of a woman's ability to succeed at the highest levels here. 
"Except for the fact that there are so few women in dev, the environment is good.  The work is good, the mission is admirable, etc."
"When men are aggressive they are rewarded.  Med don't have to prove themselves functionally or leadership-wise.  Women are held back often, with the excuse of ""don't want to give you too much"" or ""prove you've been consistently delivering results"".  Men can make mistakes that women can't. "
"As a woman at XXX, I do not feel uncomfortable or labeled.  I feel able to voice any discomfort, and would feel comfortable going to my manager with an issues.  However, I don't feel that my experience is 100% consistent with that of some other women."
"I think the overall environment is good, but still don't feel as supported as I'd like."
"Advancement it is all about who you know, who you hang out with on the week-ends, etc. "
"Stereotypes are a real thing and the old boys club is so tiresome.  Woman are emotional, men are passionate.  Woman are aggressive, men get things done.  It is so frustrating."
"Unfortunately, SM did create a hostile environment for women, not all women, but many women.  Am optimistic that things might change. "
I lead a team outside of WAT.  I do believe the overall environment is better in Princeton/for the Epocrates business where we have had prior woman leadership.  
Hoping we can engage a significant culture shift away from the old boy's network (or the younger man's network) with change in leadership.  Implicit bias may still be there but hoping for a positive change
I do feel supported and have the flexibility I need for my family.
At times it feels as if there is more of a bias against those not in Watertown vs. women but it is unknown if this is an excuse to maintain a work environment that keeps 'friends' together.
Ensuring that performance reviews do not capture any information relating to being a woman or documenting that a woman was out on leave (maternity) is important; not just for women but also for men (paternity)
"It's definitely a ""good ole boy"" place; there is a lot of lip service being paid to gender equity, but not a lot of action."
"If you want to attract more senior women into XXX you need to start creating incentives that they would like. For instance, not buckets of nerf guns, strategy board games and craft beers. How about you sponsor an organization like Tomorrow's women today. How about you host a series of women speakers? "
"With Steven's departure, I believe there is potential for a shift in the overall work environment created for women at senior levels, however the culture is still in need of a shift to support dual-working families. "
"In general the team culture across the organization is supportive. The tenor of conversations in the C-suite gets very inappropriate at times though with frequent cursing, rants and personal attacks. I believe this is a minority of SLT, but even men commented to me how uncomfortable it makes them to have this going on when the room has a bunch of men and a couple token females. Even other leaders commented on some of this behavior being sexist and inappropriate. "
I think more needs to be done.
This is an amazing work environment where  accommodations like nursing mother's rooms are made available.   
Too many politics and not enough credit/future opportunities given to people who just consistently deliver. 
"Overall, the environment is improving - women are moving from seething to speaking out. There are plenty of opportunities for women to take on initiatives, but it doesn't mean they are given extra resources to support that effort. Instead its more a piling on and slog-your-guts-out situation. Where there is still an issue is more insidious and harder to define - male leadership scope-grabbing and empire-building. I've been in a number of situations where I've built a team and male VPs  try to co-opt pieces of it, or in the very least take credit for it. "
"VP and above leadership cohorts seem like a boys' club where social connections/network might be made over ""drinks"", after office-hours, or similar events less conducive to women. In leadership discussions, I'm very aware that I'm usually one of a few women in the room"
"Lots of women work here, not so many in tech.  Should continue to actively address this."
